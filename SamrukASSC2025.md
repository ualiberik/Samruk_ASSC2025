# Samruk Station
## Location and mission of the settlement [A]
Our team chose the polar orbit of the Moon as the location of our space settlement.
##### “...But why, some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal?...” 
We are not limited in the scale of the project, but we want it to be as realistic and achievable as possible. 
Moon — is the closest and most thoroughly explored celestial body, but still not settled. In our opinion, we need to overcome this frontier, before we will move beyond.
A station in the orbit of the Moon can be a transhipment point or spaceport in long-distance missions, such as missions to Mars, Venus, Mercury and the outer solar system, where spacecrafts can refuel and have repair. Thus, settlement in the orbit of the Moon would be a very important step toward the colonizing of the solar system.

### Station will be located in 600km polar orbit, because:
- Polar orbit allows near-continuous exposure to sunlight. The moon’s axial tilt is only 5.145° [1], which means the poles are constantly illuminated by the Sun.
- Polar orbit and rotation of the moon around its axis allows to land on any point on the surface.
- 600km altitude is more stable and requires less amount of corrections, but still close enough to the surface.
### Space settlement can be fully autonomous.
- The moon surface consists not very much, but enough water [2] to provide for the needs of the biosphere and infrastructure in the settlement.
- The surface of the moon have a lot of Helium-3 [3] — which can cover the fuel and energetics needs of the station.
- Lunar regolith is very similar to the Earth rock by the chemical compound (and consists of silicon, iron, aluminum, calcium etc.) [4] which can be used as building material for the new modules of the station.
- Space near the Moon has fewer dozens of radiation compared with the outer solar system and gas giants. About 0.96-1.24 мSv/day at the Moon's orbit [5].
