# Mechanical damage:
Since small cosmic objects, such as micrometeoroids, can strike the station, structural protection is required. Space is filled with debris, and it’s impossible to avoid every collision, so minor impacts will occur. In space, particles as small as 1 mm can travel at speeds of 20–70 km/s. At such velocities, even a tiny particle carries energy comparable to that of a bullet from a firearm.

# Temperatures:
To prevent the station from overheating due to solar radiation and internal heat generation, thermal protection and heat dissipation systems (such as radiators and ammonia-based heat pipes) are required. Nearly half of the Sun’s energy is infrared radiation, with additional ultraviolet and charged solar wind particles.
Without reflective coatings (such as aluminized Kapton, white paint, or photonic crystals), the station’s hull would heat up quickly—like a metal sheet under the Sun.

# Radiation:
Since the Moon lacks both a magnetic field and an atmosphere like Earth’s, nearly 100% of cosmic rays reach its surface. Therefore, the station itself needs robust protection from radiation, which is extremely harmful to humans.
According to research, radiation levels in lunar orbit reach about 1.37 mSv per day, equivalent to 500 mSv per year. For humans, this exceeds Earth’s natural background level of about 3 mSv per year.
For long-term habitation and generational life, the dose should be reduced to 20 mSv per year, and for pregnant women to 6.6 mGy per year. In other words, only about 4% of the external radiation should reach the crew.

The station’s radiation protection is based on a multi-layered shielding system, with each layer serving a specific function:

## Outer layer
– white Beta cloth, as used on the ISS, provides thermal resistance, reflects light, and protects against surface degradation.

## Second layer
– MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) made of aluminized Kapton, about 0.05 cm thick with a surface density of 0.007 g/cm², reflects solar radiation and minimizes thermal fluctuations. This material reflects over 90% of light and prevents excessive heating. It’s widely used on the ISS, the James Webb Telescope, and other space missions.

## Third layer
– a self-healing composite panel made of Dyneema fibers filled with polyethylene glycol and silica particles, 6.5 cm thick, 11.8 g/cm² in density. When punctured by micrometeoroids, the layer seals itself almost instantly. Under rotation and vacuum, solid microspheres move toward the puncture, where shear-thickening of the liquid filler causes it to solidify, forming a dense plug that restores integrity. The Dyneema mesh redistributes stress, allowing the layer to endure multiple impacts without failure. This innovative material enables long-duration missions by reducing the need for external repairs.

## Fourth layer
– boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) composite, 10 cm thick, 14 g/cm² density. BNNTs have exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability, and radiation attenuation properties, making them ideal for lightweight yet durable space structures.

## Fifth layer
– water shield, 40 cm thick, 40 g/cm² density. Due to hydrogen content, water effectively absorbs protons and neutrons; NASA recognizes it as an excellent radiation shield material.

## Sixth layer
– Kevlar layer, 0.5 cm thick, 0.72 g/cm² density. Kevlar, five times stronger than steel by weight, captures micrometeoroid fragments and resists tearing. It’s often used in Whipple shields for impact protection.

## Seventh layer
– high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 30 cm thick, 28.5 g/cm² density, adds hydrogen-rich shielding for proton and neutron attenuation.

## Eighth layer
– anodized aluminum structural hull, 0.35 cm thick, 0.945 g/cm² density, providing airtightness and mechanical strength.

## Final layer
– anodized aluminum alloy 6061-T6 (3.5 mm thick, up to 7 mm in key sections) forms the structural frame and outer shell. The anodized coating improves wear resistance, reflectivity, UV protection, and resistance to plasma and electrostatic charge buildup.

## Windows:
To allow observation of space without sacrificing radiation protection, multilayer transparent windows are proposed: borosilicate glass (17.5 mm), transparent polycarbonate (10 mm), transparent ceramic (25 mm), a thin barium or lead glass layer (4 mm), and external shutters made from aluminum alloy and Kapton (2 cm thick). This combination maintains clarity while blocking most harmful radiation.

### Radiation attenuation calculation:
Attenuation follows the exponential law:
D = D₀·e^(-x/λ), where λ ≈ 30 g/cm², D₀ = 500 mSv/year, and total shielding mass thickness x ≈ 95 g/cm².
Thus, D ≈ 20 mSv/year, corresponding to the recommended safe level for long-term habitation.

Such a multi-layer system provides impact resistance, excellent thermal control, and strong radiation protection. Innovative materials like the self-healing Dyneema composite and BNNTs enhance durability, enabling safe, long-duration missions in deep space.

Additionally, radiation sensors will monitor solar flare activity; in case of intense events, crew members can move to specially reinforced radiation shelters inside the station.
