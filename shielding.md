# Mechanical damage:
Since small space objects, such as micrometeorites, can hit the station, the structure needs to be protected. There are many bodies in space, and not all of them can be avoided, so collisions will be minimal. In space, particles as small as 1 mm can travel at speeds of up to 20-70 km/s.
At these speeds, even a microparticle has the same energy as a bullet from a firearm.
# Temperatures:
To prevent the station itself from overheating from the sun and internal heating processes, protection and heat dissipation are required using radiators and heat dissipation systems with ammonia tubes. Almost half of the solar energy comes in the form of infrared radiation, as well as ultraviolet radiation and solar wind particles.
Without reflective coatings (such as aluminum-coated captan, white paint, and photonic crystals), the station's body quickly heats up like a metal sheet in the sun.
