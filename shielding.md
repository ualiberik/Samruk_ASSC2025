# Mechanical damage:
Since small space objects, such as micrometeorites, can hit the station, structural protection is required. There are many bodies in space, and not all of them can be avoided, so there will be minimal collisions. In space, particles as small as 1 mm can move at speeds of up to 20-70 km/s.
At these speeds, even a microparticle has the same energy as a bullet from a firearm.
# Temperatures:
To prevent the station itself from overheating from the influence of the sun and internal heating processes, it is required to protect and remove heat using radiators and heat removal systems with ammonia pipes. Almost half of the Sun's energy is infrared radiation, and there is also ultraviolet radiation and solar wind particles.
Without reflective coatings (such as aluminum-coated kaptone, white paint, and photonic crystals), the station's body quickly heats up like a metal sheet in the sun.
